This is a program of server and a client
where server builds a connection so that client may add into it
When client gets connected then it sends a group of 5 strings and waits until 
server sends the number of highest string(string id)
client reads that string id, and again sends the 5 strings  corresponding to the next id of received id
and this continues until last id get reached

In unix domain socket: we build that connection using sockets, by using some functions like bind listen connect send recv etc.
In FIFO: we build that connection using FIFO(named pipes), by using some functions like mkfifo read write etc.
In shared memory: we build that connection using shared memory, by using some functions like bind listen connect etc.

on average fastness of my programs: shared memory > unix domain socket > FIFO
